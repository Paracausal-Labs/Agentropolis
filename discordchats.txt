hello, anyone from uniswap here? i got a couple questions regarding the privacy track 🙂
0xJoydeeeep — 28/01/2026, 18:53
Question for uniswap team, When you say 'reliability over speculative intelligence,' are you ruling out statistical models like volatility estimation, or just black-box ML and price prediction? We want to know if transparent, auditable probabilistic reasoning is in scope.
Syv

 — 28/01/2026, 21:33
Looking forward to the privacy track, will be looking to ask some questions soon as well
BearPrince — 28/01/2026, 22:01
Would uniswap be interested in A zk orderbook built on top of uniswap hooks or CCA? 
Angela O  🦄Role icon, Plus Member — 28/01/2026, 22:42
Hi hi! Yes, how can we help? 

@Dayitva @Potatoofdoom
dirtybongwater3908 — 28/01/2026, 22:52
Is it possible for a dm to discuss project?
BearPrince — 29/01/2026, 02:42
actually on that note how interested would the uniswap team be in anything built on top of CCA really. A little suprised to not see it mentioned in the prizes section.

N I K H I L — 30/01/2026, 09:48
Hey can i have a bunch of questions regarding uniswap.
Is the api restricted to certail regions?
hirugohan — 30/01/2026, 15:12
curious for this as well. excited to brainstorm with uniswap team and other hackers!
Syv

 — 30/01/2026, 19:24
Hello @Angela O  🦄 ,

I’m thinking of designing a Uniswap v4 Hook for the Privacy Track and want to clarify if you're prioritizing 'Institutional Privacy' (ZK-Identity/FHE) or 'User Anonymity' (mixer-style logic) for this prize.

Given current regulatory trends, do you view AML-aware features (like ZK-KYC gates) as a winning 'fair play' requirement or a limitation on the tech?

Basically: are you looking for a tool that hides the source of funds, or a tool that hides the strategy of the trade?
DayitvaRole icon, ETHGlobal India — 30/01/2026, 20:19
I believe the speculative intelligence part refers to LLMs deciding the pool actions or adjacent categories. That reasoning should be fine as long as you show good enough agentic capabilities.
DayitvaRole icon, ETHGlobal India — 30/01/2026, 20:20
Sure!
DayitvaRole icon, ETHGlobal India — 30/01/2026, 20:24
The prize categories are kept general to encompass a wide range of projects. Feel free to build on top of CCA but make sure to add agentic and/or privacy elements to it
DayitvaRole icon, ETHGlobal India — 30/01/2026, 20:25
Both should be fine

Thanks.
Meek — 31/01/2026, 14:09
Hey UF team, @Singgih Tara wants to create a stablecoin NOT pegged 1:1 and may need a custom curve that depends on a purchasing power index. I think a hook would work here, hope they can find help here. 
XOHAM — 31/01/2026, 14:32
@Angela O  🦄 few quetions around uniswap and our project could we discuss in dms?
Singgih Tara — 31/01/2026, 16:13
I think this is possible if I integrate it with Uniswap. However, I still need to learn Uniswap v4 hooks first, and I need good learning resources for that.
San — 31/01/2026, 21:35
Hi @Meek and @Singgih Tara, yes, a hook could be used for this, we’ll be around if you need any help.

Just keep in mind that our tracks for this hackathon are focused on Agentic Finance and Privacy, not on hooks alone. You’re welcome to use hooks as an added component if they meaningfully support your project.
Singgih Tara — 31/01/2026, 22:36
oke san, can you help me to refer the documentation privacy defi on uniswap?
San — 31/01/2026, 23:21
The Privacy DeFi track focuses on mechanisms that improve how information is handled during onchain trading and liquidity provision.

The key requirement is that the project must be built on top of Uniswap v4,here’s the documentation: https://docs.uniswap.org/

Hello team! 
My project plans to use uniswap as a liquidity normalisation layer. Then my agents will use Uniswap to convert ERC-20 tokens to USDC and perform trades. Is this a good fit for agentic finance track? 
SkyGuy — 01/02/2026, 11:41
Hello mentors,
I am working to do a swap using V4 on Arbitrum Sepolia (WETH-USDC pair). But cannot do that. I also tried to initialise a pool and add liquidity to it on Arbitum Sepolia, but failed to do so. I see the UI at app.uniswap.org (in testnet mode) is allowing Ethereum Sepolia and Uniswap Sepolia only.

Is there support on Arbitrum Sepolia? If not, which chain should I use?
hirugohan — 01/02/2026, 14:00
I believe that Arbitrum Sepolia is supported but I haven't tried it myself https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/deployments#testnet-deployments

I'm planning to toying around in Unichain Sepolia
SkyGuy — 01/02/2026, 15:26
Yes, saw the docs, and I used those addresses to make the calls for  the WETH/USDC pool on Arbitrum Sepolia, but the tx fails. Was able to do so on V3 successfully.
ZexoRole icon, Plus Member — 01/02/2026, 21:26
hello @Angela O  🦄 how can i get more Unichain Sepolia ETH ? is just limited on faucets
Youtpout — 01/02/2026, 22:51
Hello,

I would like to combine several offchain intent swaps into a single onchain swap and submit this swap through the uniswap v4 router, is that enough to be eligible for the bounty?
payreuben.eth — Yesterday at 11:24
gmgm, do we have to use Unichain in order to qualify for the prize; is it okay if we deploy a fork on Arc testnet and still be elligible?
prapti1211 — Yesterday at 12:18
Hello @Angela O  🦄 @San @Meek ,
Is Uniswap v4 currently supported on any testnets?
If yes, could you please share which testnets are available and which pools we should use for testing?
N I K H I L — Yesterday at 12:57
same question for me too

please are there pools on testnet we could deploy to? 

or we have to create them ourselves/deploy to mainnet pools?

N I K H I L — Yesterday at 20:56
@Dayitva @San  hey i had to deploy my own contracts for v4 on arcnet since uniswap v4 was opensource.
Would that have any issues with my submission?
@San also ive booked a slot at 8.30pm ist, very excited to discuss our project idea
@San  and is deploying uniswap on other unregistered testnets frowned upon in anyway?
N I K H I L — Yesterday at 21:00
im asking because of this
winverse — Yesterday at 21:04
booked for tomorrow 2pm UTC, thanks
ZexoRole icon, Plus Member — Yesterday at 21:05
i just booked on 4 feb, 8:00 pm . see u
San — Yesterday at 21:08
as Daytiva said, avoid deploying on other networks, use the Sepolia networks we listed in the documentation
N I K H I L — Yesterday at 21:09
@San yes i do understand, but im using another testnet because they have support for Developer Controlled Wallets and that helps me make my app autonomous
other chains dont have that so im using Arc, would that affect my submission in any way?
payreuben.eth — Yesterday at 21:27
Thanks, in that case is it okay if we a separate deployment to demo our app for the uniswap track; and another deployment for our ARC demo?
lowkeyloki — Yesterday at 22:55
For the uniswap track, is it compulsory to deploy the uniswap hook?
Akhil — Yesterday at 23:38
No, building hooks is not mandatory, you can if you wish
Youtpout — Yesterday at 23:42
@Dayitva Hello,

I would like to combine several offchain intent swaps into a single onchain swap and submit this swap through the uniswap v4 router, is that enough to be eligible for the bounty?
DayitvaRole icon, ETHGlobal India — Yesterday at 23:59
In that case, you can try using something like Privy or CDP server wallets for autonomous handling but please don't deploy new forks on other networks.

yellow track 
Hello and welcome to the ⁠ ⁠partner-yellow   channel :nfteth:
Feel free to reach out to the Yellow  Team at any point with your questions!

👀 About
Yellow Network lets you deposit crypto once and make lightning-fast transactions without waiting for blockchain confirmations or paying gas each time. It combines the best of both worlds — the speed of off-chain systems and the security of smart contracts.
Most interactions between parties don't need immediate on-chain settlement. Consider a chess game with a 10 USDC wager:
On-chain approach: Every move requires a transaction → 40+ transactions → $100s in fees
State channel approach: Lock funds once, play off-chain, settle once → 2 transactions → minimal fees
State channels let you execute unlimited off-chain operations between on-chain checkpoints.
💡 How it works:
When you send funds or interact with an app, your transfers happen off-chain through a secure network of Yellow nodes that keep balances in sync. It feels instant, like using a regular web2 app. Smart contracts on each blockchain act as safes: they hold your deposit, verify everything, and make sure your money is protected. If you ever stop using the app or want to withdraw, your final balance is settled on-chain. Your session is protected by unique digital keys that only you control. No one can change your balance or take your funds. Even if something goes wrong, your assets automatically return to you.
🚀 Key features:
Works as a Layer-2 network, not a new blockchain
Enables real-time, gasless payments that still settle safely on your preferred chain
Designed for games, apps, and tools that need instant user actions and smooth UX
Includes built-in liquidity pools to make sure there’s always capital available for fast transactions
Compatible with all EVM chains, Solana and others coming soon.

Is the yellow protocol compatible with Arc? I want to build a system that uses state channels from Yellow with settlement on Arc. Is this possible?
Akhil — 01/02/2026, 03:32
It is chain agnostic
sameerag19 — 01/02/2026, 03:36
So yellow’s custody contract is deployed on the arc test?
_ — 01/02/2026, 03:41
Yeah I know it’s EVM chain agnostic, but I’m not sure if the clearnodes support Arc. I ran the get config query to get the list of supported networks and I get the following chain ids:

⁨
  ytest.usd — chain 11155111, token 0xDB9F293e3898c9E5536A3be1b0C56c89d2b32DEb
  ytest.usd — chain 59141, token 0xDB9F293e3898c9E5536A3be1b0C56c89d2b32DEb
  ytest.usd — chain 80002, token 0xDB9F293e3898c9E5536A3be1b0C56c89d2b32DEb
  ytest.usd — chain 84532, token 0xDB9F293e3898c9E5536A3be1b0C56c89d2b32DEb
  ytest.usd — chain 1449000, token 0xDB9F293e3898c9E5536A3be1b0C56c89d2b32DEb
  eth — chain 0, token 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

This doesn't include the Arc testnet. Maybe I am missing something or misunderstanding something?

Hey ENS team — for HackMoney, is there any way to get a sponsored ENS .eth name or a subname under an ENS you control for demo use? I need to set an addr record and a couple of text records. What’s the best process to request this? Thanks! 
k!ller — 30/01/2026, 23:09
i would typically use the testnet for this 
Vitaly — 31/01/2026, 00:02
Same — but some of the integrations don’t support testnets, so I’ll do a tiny mainnet demo with strict limits + tx hashes.

Hey ENS team, I have a few questions on how I use ENS for my project, can we discuss in DMs?
Thank you.

Is it possible to buy an .eth name on testnet with testnet ETH?

Yes, on ethereum sepolia you can do that

Am I on the wrong domain? https://app.ens.domains/ 
I don't see the option to switch to Ethereum Sepolia (only ETH mainnet available) 
Akhil — Yesterday at 17:10
Use this - https://sepolia.app.ens.domains/
